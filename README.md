# Accessing Windows 10 Remote Desktop on Azure VM via IP address

Welcome! This tutorial will walk you through the process of setting up and connecting to a **Remote Desktop (RDP)** session on an **Azure Virtual Machine** using its **Public IP address**. By the end, you'll be able to access your Azure VM from anywhere!

---

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, youâ€™ll need the following:

- A **Microsoft Azure** account
- Basic knowledge of **Azure Virtual Machines**
- An **RDP client** on your computer (e.g., **Windows Remote Desktop**, or **Microsoft Remote Desktop for macOS**)

---

## Operating Systems Used

- **Microsoft Windows 11** (version 21H2)

---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Create a Resource Group

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Resource Groups** using the search bar.
2. Click on **+ Create** to start the process of creating a new resource group.

3. Give your resource group a name (e.g., **MyResourceGroup**). 
4. Select a region that works best for you. Make sure to note down the region, as youâ€™ll need it when creating your virtual machine.
5. Click **Review + Create**, then hit **Create** when you're ready.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine

1. Once your resource group is created, search for **Virtual Machines** in the Azure portal and click on **+ Create**.

2. Select the resource group you just created. This will help keep everything organized.

3. For the **VM Name**, you can use the same name as the resource group, but itâ€™s a good idea to pick something distinct so that it's easier to identify.

4. Choose the same **Region** for the VM as the resource group to reduce data transfer costs, improve performance, and make management easier.

5. For **Image**, select **Windows 10 Pro**.

6. Choose a **VM size**. Select a size with at least **2 vCPUs** for optimal performance.
7. Creat a **Username and Password** they will be used to login into Remote desktop.

- Don't forget to check the licensing box.
- click next to networking.

### Step 3: Networking and IP address

1. In the **Networking** section, ensure that a **Public IP** is selected. This will allow you to connect to your VM remotely.

2. Make sure the **Network Security Group (NSG)** allows **RDP (Port 3389)** traffic. This is essential for connecting via Remote Desktop.

   - If itâ€™s not set up, you can add a rule to allow inbound RDP traffic (Port 3389).

---

### Step 4: Review and Create the VM

1. After configuring your VM and networking settings, click **Review + Create** to review your selections.

2. When youâ€™re satisfied, click **Create** to deploy the VM.

---

### Step 5: Connect to Your Virtual Machine Using RDP

1. Once your VM is deployed, navigate to the **Overview** page of your VM in the Azure portal.
2. Copy the **Public IP address** of your VM. Youâ€™ll use this to connect remotely.
   

3. Open **Remote Desktop Connection** on your local computer (type **mstsc** in the Run dialog on Windows).
4. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste the **Public IP address** of your VM and click **Connect**.
5. When prompted, enter the **username** and **password** you created during the VM setup.

---

## Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re having trouble connecting, here are a few things to check:

- Ensure that your **Public IP** address is correctly assigned and static.
- Make sure that **Port 3389** is open in your **Network Security Group** to allow RDP traffic.
- If you're still having issues, try restarting your VM or check the **Azure firewall settings**.

---

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've successfully set up your **Windows 10 Azure VM** and connected via **Remote Desktop** using a **Public IP address**! Now you can access and manage your VM remotely with ease.
